* The goal of this challenge-4 is to get familiarize with Javascript and APIs, how to create and work with Local Storages taught in the class. 

* Comments:
  - Due to my travel to Seoul Korea and Shanghi China, I couldn't finish the project on time.
  - But, when I returned from travel, I have worked on it and completed the challenge.
  - I've managed to display the blogs in a table format, but couldn't find out how to display the contents in local storage with a box.
  - If I have more time to work on it, I will update the result and re-submit it when done.
  - Other than that, I think I've met all the acceptance criteria.
  - I have reused the codes that have been explored during the activities, and utilized Xpert Learning Assistant a lot. 
  - Challenge results are captured and explained in a separate pdf file showing what has been done
